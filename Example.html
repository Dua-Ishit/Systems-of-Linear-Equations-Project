        <h3  class="text-sizeh3" style="text-align:center;">Finding the age</h3>
            <p  class="text-size" style="text-align:center;">Joe is 2 times as old as his brother, Jack. Together, they have a combined age of 21 years. If Joe's age is <em>x</em> and Jack's age is represented by <em>y</em>, what is each child's age? Write and solve a system of linear equations the represent this situation by substitution.
                <br>First, set up two equations that represent this situation:
                <br>x=2y
                <br>x+y=21
                <br>Next, substitute the value of x from the first equation into the second equation:
                <br>2y+y=21
                <br>3y=21
                <br>y=7
                <br>Substitute the value of y back into one on the original equations:
                <br>x=2(7)
                <br>x=14
                <br>So, Joe is 14 years old and Jack is 7 years old.
