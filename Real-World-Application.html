                                Bill wants to start a 3-D printing business. He figures out that it will cost $250 to get a good 3-D printer that can serve his needs and then an additional $1.4 to make the item. To help him start the business, his parents give him $100. If he sells each item for $11.4, how many items would he have to sell in order to "break even"? Write and solve a system of linear equations that represents this situation.
                                <br>First, define the variables:
                                <br>Let the cost in dollars be represented by <em>C</em>
                                <br>Let the <em><b>in</b></em>come in dollars be represented by <em>I</em>
                                <br>Let the number of items 3D printed be <em>x</em>
                                <br>Write the equations:
                                <br><em>C</em>= 1.4x + 250
                                <br><em>I</em>= 11.4x + 100
                            </p>>

                                <br>Graph these equations:

                                <br>As you can see in this graph, Bill will "break even" when he sells the 15th item.

                                In order for Bill to break even, the two equations must equal each other.
                                <br><em>C</em>=<em>I</em>
                                <br>1.4x+250=11.4x+100
                                <br>150=10x
                                <br>x=15

                                <br><em>C</em>=<em>I</em>
                                <br>Use variable <em>y</em> instead of <em>I</em> and <em>C</em> to solve the system.
                                <br>y = 1.4x + 250
                                <br>y = 11.4x + 100
                                <br>Subtract the first equation from the second one to eliminate <em>y</em>.
