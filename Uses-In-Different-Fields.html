            <h2  class="text-sizeh2" style="text-align:center;">What are Systems of Linear Equations?</h2>
                <p class="text-size" style="text-align:center;">Systems of linear equations are collections of two or more linear equations involving the same set of variables. There are many uses of them in fields like engineering, finance, and environment science.<br>

        <h2 class="text-sizeh2" style="text-align:center;">Uses in different fields</h2>
            <h3 class="text-sizeh3" style="text-align:center;">Finance</h3>
                <p class="text-size" style="text-align:center;">Systems of linear equations are useful in finance because they can model various scenarios involving costs, revenues, profits, supply, demand, and more. For example, a system of linear equations can help a company determine the optimal production level of different products, given the restrictions on resources, demand, and costs. A system of linear equations can also help a financial institution determine the best use of different assets, given the expected returns, risks, and benefits.</p>
            <h3 class="text-sizeh3" style="text-align:center;">Engineering</h3>
                <p class="text-size" style="text-align: center;">Systems of linear equations are used in engineering to describe how a system behaves. They are easier to solve than non-linear equations, so engineers choose to work with systems of linear equations regularly by making a non-linear problem linear. Linear systems of equations naturally occur in many places in engineering, such as structural analysis, dynamics and electric circuits. Engineers use linear equations to calculate measurements for both solids and liquids. For example, an electrical engineer uses linear equations to solve problems involving voltage, current and resistance.</p>
                <h3 class="text-sizeh3" style="text-align:center;">Airlines</h3>
                <img src="AirplanePath.jpg" alt="Linear airplane paths" class="center1">
                <p class="text-size" style="text-align:center;">Systems of linear equations a<em><b>re</b></em> also used by people who map out the flight paths in order to make sure that no two flights are going to get too close to one another. This is done by graphing lines that shows the flight path of airplanes and then checking to see that there are no points of intersection.</p>
            <h3 class="text-sizeh3" style="text-align:center;">Environmental Science</h3>
                <p class="text-size" style="text-align:center;">Systems of linear equations are also used in environmental science to predict animal populations to make sure that the populations continue to thrive and grow without overpopulation.</p>
